# Bidsketch Coding Challenge

This basic application is your starting point for the Bidsketch Coding Challenge.

## Delivery

1. [Duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository on your Github account (don't fork it)
2. Add [`genericsteele`](https://github.com/genericsteele) as a collaborator
3. Commit your work on a feature branch
4. Open a pull request that sticks to the following guidelines:
    - It's functional
    - It consists of minimal, logically organized commits
    - It provides a summary of your work
    - It demonstrates the features
    - It's as simple as possible
    - It stays inside the project scope
5. Assign `genericsteele` to review the pull request
